# CousinsRetreat
## Origin
At one point in my life I thought, "My attachment to my cousin is so excellent ðŸ¤˜, I think I should make a tribute to them by making something". I didn't know what I would make but I new it was gonna be the best present I have ever made for them.
## Choice
I was messing around with html at the time so I decided to make a website. I spent the last 2 months working on it but now I am officially finished.
